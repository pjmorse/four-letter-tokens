Four Letter Tokens
==================

A Ruby solution for https://gist.github.com/seanthehead/7220609 .

To run, after cloning this repository, open IRB, require `'./checker.rb'`, and instantiate `Checker` with the relative path to the dictionary file as an argument (e.g. `check = Checker.new('./dictionary.txt')`). Result will be written to `sequences` and `words`.
